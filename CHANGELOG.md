and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 29.0.0 (2024-07-29)

### Chore

 - <csr-id-5f066f26e347d80edd3cc9480d362b39ce762bd6/> update ratatui to 0.26.0
   Requires an update to tui-react / crosstermion to work

### Other

 - <csr-id-aab09862ce8ff64d3c9bafd099e81df89c4c1670/> switch from `time` to `jiff`
   This swaps out `time` in favor of `jiff` for getting and formatting the
   local time.
   
   Note that this does add the `%Z` to the format string, which will write
   out time zone abbreviations like `EDT` along with the local datetime
   itself. The `time` crate doesn't support this, but jiff's tzdb
   integration let's it do it.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-f3c3122a571512d0d90edced6f1057f395c9d39f/> upgrade `ratatui` to v0.26

### New Features

 - <csr-id-6acf6fe22a9ec4f7a16626db556c051c2084ccb2/> Change duration formatting to be more human readable.
   Note that this changes duration output from something like `69d10h40m`

   After the most recent update, certion event-related features in crosstermion
   stopped working in the context of the GUI, so it's probably best to let it go.
   
   By now, `crosstermion` is also very much a more portable replacement.

## 26.0.0 (2023-09-04)

This release is all about making `dyn` possible both for nested progress, as well as for 'simple' one (previously known as `RawProgress`).
Switching to this release naturally makes it possible for users of `Progress` to also use `dyn Progress`, as this trait is now object safe (formerly `RawProgress`).
If there are compile errors, the code now needs `NestedProgress`, instead of `Progress`, and possibly the import of the `Count` trait.
Finally, it's recommended to review all usages of `Progress` as they can possibly be replaced with `Count` which provides the guarantee that only counting happens,
and no change of the progress information itself.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-6aba6e34f3e39bba5e609a0bc780c758cb43c821/> split `Progress` into various super-traits to allow most of them to be dyn-safe.
   `Progress` is now `NestedProgress`, `RawProgress` is now `Progress`, and there is
   a new `Count` trait for solely counting things.
 - <csr-id-6c60835ae49487a220b1817bc6cea3ebc8bf1aff/> `Progress::counter()` is now mandatory.
   This should simplify downstream code and we just accept that we are dealing
   with a threaded world.
   This also comes with performance improvements as increments are now 250% faster.

## 25.0.0 (2023-05-16)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-8941f4b5b9c0d00dfd7b82c756b128982f163a06/> Introduce the object-safe `RawProgress` trait.
   It's automatically implemented for `Progress` and allows for more flexible use
   of progress particularly in leaf nodes. This is useful if a function needs to take
   multiple types of progress as it is called from different places in the same function.
   
   Without dyn-traits, it's not possible to make such call.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-84d96c7b6ab07462d6c20147958d5aa1a58a688e/> Make messaging functions thread-safe by taking shared borrow and requring `Sync`.
   That way it's possible to share the `RawProgress` object across threads and emit messages,
   much like a logging system that's more integrated with rendering.

## 23.1.2 (2023-03-11)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-7966f79cc7009acb33761cee70398b05b0006cc1/> line renderer now properly detects changes.
   Previously change-detection was implemented based on the assumption that
   the progress tree is copied entirely. Now, however, the interesting values
   are shared.
   
   The change-detection was adjusted to keep the state's hash of the most recent
   drawing, instead of doing everything in line, which saves time hashing as well.

## 23.1.0 (2023-02-28)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-6f966b4f859f1b02775dcb3461bacf46b46ab707/> improve performance of `progress::tree` operations by more than 50%.
   This was done by implementing shared state in a simple Mutex protected hashmap
   which for typical programs with less contention is faster than using the `dashmap`
   crate.
   
   However, for those who know they need it, the previous implementation is still available
   in with the `progress-tree-hp-hashmap` feature toggle.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-a1db1b27fc7f14be052bbfc660c9c9b174c1d3cc/> Implement `Hash` for `Task` to avoid redrawing if nothing changes with the Line renderer.

## 22.1.0 (2022-12-06)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-ea9aa5815ef2d1c734b85c185ddb65ac731b1195/> `progress::Key` now supports 6 levels of hierarchy instead of 4.

## 22.0.0 (2022-12-05)

<csr-id-46aeffd13cda49146c8a33e93c8c9b0fbcb15c8b/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-46aeffd13cda49146c8a33e93c8c9b0fbcb15c8b/> switch to Rust edition 2021

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-53cb09dc0314b0e8ce58dc50e0c07a053b963ccd/> remove `Tree` and `TreeOptions` in favor of `tree::Root` and `tree::root::Options`.
   Previously it was confusing what a tree Root actually is due to the
   rename, and ambiguity isn't what we would want here.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-edab37364276864d45241c2946173388a0602f23/> `From<tree::root::Options> for tree::Root`, `tree::root::Options::create()` returns `tree::Root` instead of `Arc`.
   That way we won't be forced to produce an `Arc` if it's not needed.

## 21.1.0 (2022-11-23)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-c332a6f266a6ae0cacf19cb523e551bb63c1e7ea/> identify each progress item with `Id` using `add_child_with_id()`.
   An `Id` is four bytes like b"TREE" that are stable and
   identify progress items (as created by `add_child(…)` within
   a function call.
   
   Callers may use this knowledge to pick specific progress items
   for consumption, instead of trying to rely on identifying tasks
   by name which may change.
   
   The identifier can also be queried with `Progress::id()`, even
   though it could be `prodash::progress::UNKNOWN` if the progress
   item wasn't created with `add_child_with_id()`.

## 21.0.0 (2022-10-17)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-3347a0294c5b95270c34de9f396214353baea36d/> `impl Progress for &mut T: where T: Progress`.
   This makes it possible to hand borrowed progress implementations to
   functions that need progress reporting, making the usage of progress
   easier.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-300181bdd4b2ef1822dddd1fe814d7e3e5b26779/> remove `Progress: 'static` requirement.
   This requirement can be added where used and where needed, and
   originally snuck in because it was easier and `Progress` implementations
   typically are `'static` as well.
   
   However, that requirement made it impossible to implement `Progoress`
   for `&mut T where T: Progress`.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-4904065a51594b5bc4f32a247e513b45093373fa/> Add `Progress::set_max()` to set the highgest expected progress value.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-414bc71e79475335345dbc529566a6efc3afee23/> don't reset the shared counter value on `init`.
   It's possible to re-initialize the progress, and when that's done
   it would detach the counter from previous instances that might have
   been observed by callers to `counter()`, which is surprising.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-cba841c828142c0dd028dd9413c31f509f2bbb1b/> Improve render-log performance greatly.
   Previously it would check the current time each time somebody
   wants to log on any logger, greatly reducing performance as
   it would block on the mutex rust-std uses internally.
   
   Now we use a single thread to provide information about whether or not
   we may log, whose lifetime is bound to all of the log instances it
   governs.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b6d5245344bde92672cd98aecacb5d94ecca4e19/> Allow rendererers to respond to dropped progress roots
   Previously it needed extra effort to communicate that a the computation
   was done and the renderer should stop rendering progress.
   
   Now they only obtain a weak progress instance so it can drop if the
   computation is done, terminating it naturally and in time.
   
   Note that in case of the TUI, it would still be needed to respond
   to the GUI having shut down due to user request.

## v10.0.0 (2020-09-13)

### Breaking

* Enforce `Send + 'static` bounds for `Progress` trait.
   * This way it's clear that Progress is supposed to work in a threaded environment, which is the environment they are used in most often.
   * On the call site, this avoids having to specify these trait bounds explicitly.

<csr-id-64cfe9e87e038fb36492307dfb75cbc8204180d8/>

### New Features

* Provide various Units for improved formatting of durations, steps, counts and bytes, and specify display of percentages.
* Support for throughput display if enabled in _line_ and _tui_ renderer, and when opted in when creating units.
* Turn `ProgressStep` type into usize to allow for a broader range of values. Specifically, this enables counting bytes read and written
  of files or streams bigger than 2^32-1
* A new example program: **units**
* Add methods to help determine key hierarchy, useful for writing custom renderers: `Key::shares_parent_with(…)`,`Key::adjecency(…)`
* `Key::adjecency(…)`

### Breaking

* In `Progress::init(max, unit)` , `unit` now is `Option<Unit>`, existing code can be transformed using `progress.init(None, Some("label".into()))`.
* moved`tree::progress` into `progress` and renamed `Value` into `Task` and `Progress` into `Value`
* moved`tree::messages` into `crates::messages`
* moved`tree::key` into `crates::progress::key`
* moved `tree::Throughput` into `crate::Throughput`
* **removed** `deep_eq()` method in `Root` tree
* tui engine option `redraw_only_on_state_change` was removed without substitute
* **Move and rename**
  * `tree::ProgressState` → `progress::State`
  * `tree::Value` → `progress::Value`
  * `tree::Progress` → `Progress`
* Remove `Hash` implementation for all public types except for `tree::Key`
* Move `tui` and `line` renderers into the `render` module
* Rename `log-renderer` feature to `progress-tree-log`
* Rename `tui-renderer*` into `render-tui*` and `line-renderer*` into `render-line*`

### Other

 - <csr-id-66800fd4e6c9f517f19da4e26a75cb3f139353b0/> Attempt to impl throughput in display…
   …which can't work because it's actually never mutable due to the way
   drawing work: it operates on a snapshot, a copy, that is not written
   back.
   
   And even if it was, the type system statically concludes sync is needed
   as well for this to work.
   
   Long story short: No state changes are ever allowed with a system like
   this, and throughput needs to maintain just that.
   
   Throughput must be implemented in each renderer.
 - <csr-id-64cfe9e87e038fb36492307dfb75cbc8204180d8/> Try to manually implement/run a local executor

## v7.0.2 (2020-07-11)

* **render-line** `JoinHandle` will 
  * now send a signal to perform a render before shutting down to capture the final state
  * wait for the render thread to complete the aforementioned actions on drop. You can still override this behaviour through
   `disconnect()` or `forget()`.
  * removed special code-paths that avoided bringing up another thread for 'ticks' at the expense of shutdown delay.

## v7.0.0 (2020-07-10)

<csr-id-a684188b3eee0cc67fe48b9ae14aa9cd63603caf/>
<csr-id-1bc5c764c9b1190f168d076b2183a27569750421/>

Add new render-line, change feature flag names.

### Other

 - <csr-id-a684188b3eee0cc67fe48b9ae14aa9cd63603caf/> first version of 'slow' event loop which actually won't respond quickly either :D
 - <csr-id-1bc5c764c9b1190f168d076b2183a27569750421/> bump patch level

### New Features

* **line**
   There is a new line renderer as neat trade off between bare logs and full-blown tui. It will work best with 'simple' and not
   too dynamically changing progress trees.
   Activate it with the `render-line` + one of `render-line-crossterm` or `render-line-termion` feature flags.
* Activate it with the `render-line` + one of `render-line-crossterm` or `render-line-termion` feature flags.

### Breaking Changes

* **`tui` module**
    * **TuiOptions** -> **Options**
    * `render_with_input` now takes the Write stream as argument, instead of defaulting to `std::io::stdout()`
* **Feature Flags**
    * **with-crossterm** -> **render-tui-crossterm**
    * **with-termion** -> **render-tui-termion**

## v6.0.0 (2020-07-05)

<csr-id-bbf2651e379b5758d53a889d9fb220c616d2a096/>

Factor terminal input into the new `crosstermion` crate.

Due to this work, the default features changed, which is a breaking change for those who relied on it.
Now when using the `render-tui`, one will also have to specify either the `with-crossbeam` or `render-tui-termion` feature.

## v5.0.0 (2020-07-03)

Support for windows by using Crossbeam by default.
A first low-effort move to the latest version should be to set the dependency to
`default-features = false, features = ["render-tui", "render-tui-termion", "localtime", "log-renderer"]`
to get the same configuration as before.

To try crossbeam, use `with-crossbeam` instead of `render-tui-termion`.

If you have been using the event stream to send your own keys, swap `termion::event::Key` with `prodash::tui::input::Key`.

## v4.1.0 (2020-07-01)

Allow the TUI to automatically stop if there is no progress to display.

This way, it's easier to use `prodash::tui` for visualizing finite tasks, which originally it wasn't intended for.

Previously, in order to achieve the same, one would have to initialize the TUI with an event stream and send the Event
for shutting down once the task at hand is complete.

## v4.0.5 (2020-07-01)

Fix delayed reset of the terminal.

Previously even after the future was dropped, it seemed like the terminal wasn't reset and the user was required
to explicitly flush stdout to make the changes appear. This is due to the flushing previously happening too early,
that is, before the `terminal` was dropped which emits the respective terminal escape codes at this time.

Now the terminal instance is dropped explicitly right before emitting a flush.
One might argue that the flush should happen in the terminal instance itself, but fixing that is out of scope.

## v4.0.0 (2020-05-17)

Switch from futures executor to smol.

This actually simplifies some parts of the implementation, while fixing issues along futures not being dropped while they
were on a thread pool. Now, for the example, no threadpool is used anymore.

**Note** that this also means that in order for each frame to be drawn, one would have to invoke `smol::run` in one thread to
activate the reactor which processes the timeout/ticker. Alternatively, one would send `Tick` events through a channel to trigger
a redraw manually.
